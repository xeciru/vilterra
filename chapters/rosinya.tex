at the cusp of a great change that will some consume the world. 
Where many may see opportunity, others only find the schackles of an oppressive regime.

What ever may occur in this most holy of domain, the whole world watches.

\section{Geography} 
Sitting right on the center of vilterra's east coast. Rosinya enjoys a warm meditarean climate
with a rich land and coastal ecosystem. The country spreads across a diverse geographic
region which includes grasslands, temperate forests, low mountains, and ria coastlines.

\subsection{Weather} 
It is mostly sunny thoughout the years, exceptable for rain in the winter. 
This hosiptal environment is oft attributed to the grace of the revered 
storm god, \emph{Palid}. Although their might be an underlying current of his wrath,
as southern Rosinya has some of the roughest coastlines on the continent.
This tough enviroment has bred a powerful Naval culture which contributes 
to Rosinya's ability to project power overseas.

\subsection{Fauna and Flora}

\subsubsection{the farmlands}
Due to rosinya's unmatch fertile soil, agricultural field prolifate the entire 
kingdom. These fields are dominanted by grains such as wheat, barely, oats and vegetables
such as cabbage, kale, and lettuce. However, Rosinya is also a major producer, 
consumer, and exporter of rice. 
(in fact exporting rice to the dwarves, has become a compitition between Rosinya and the Asakhan).

Agricultural land isn't just reserved for crops, as Ranching is also domiant in Rosinya.
Cows, chickens, and pigs are by far the most common farm animals. Cheese, milk, and Egg
based products are a long time stable in Rosinyean dishes. On special occassions pigs or
cows are slaughtered to provide the indegredents for steak and sausages.

In the past, farmlands fell victim to monster targeting livestock. However both independent 
monster hunter groups and an, increasingly interventitist, central government, have managered 
to stave these attacks.

\subsubsection{fishing and sea life}
Due to the abdunce of editable sea life, Rosinya has grown a large fishing indrustry.
Upon the stalls in major cities of Rosinya it isn't uncommon to find a diverse 
supply of seafood, including fish, squid, clams, and even octopus. Although not all
of these fish are avalible to everyone. Only the rich merchants, guild members, and nobles
enjoy such cuisine as octopus. Meanwhile, the average worker often eats markerel, cod, 
or sardines. This aquatic food culture even mades it deep into the countryside. Farmers would 
rathers eat the tuna caught downstream, than slaughter a cow that could otherwise 
provide valuable milk and cheese.

\subsection{Hostile Creatures}
Despite the best efforts of the Rosinyean government and independent monster hunters.
Many mysterious creatures still roam the deep woods of Rosinya.   

\subsubsection{subnatural phenomania}
For some inexplicable reason, in the west reaches of Rosinya undead and fiendish 
creatures occasional return to the mortal plane during the night. Their prowel around, 
some searching from victims to drag prematurely into the afterlife, others more 
innocenly, observe the joys of mortal life their now lack. 

\subsubsection{horror below and above the sea}
Well at the very least the kingdom can fight off fiends and necromany on land, the 
seas along Rosinya's coasts are a whole different story. Beneath the waves the 
demonic merrow, krakens, sea turtles, and the sort lurk, waiting to strike on unsuspecting 
victims sailing on the surface. There are many a tale of lonely fishermen being
dragged down by sirens, or travelling families being petrafied by swarming cockatrice.

On the rare occasion a hydra or sea turtle graces the shores, drawing the full
attention of Rosinya's mighty navy. 

With the advent of the caravel and blackpowder cannons, naval patrols have become more 
successful at challenging these threats. Yet, there is alway's air of caution 
when heading out to sea.

\section{internal politics}
Rosinya is a land expirencing rapid and unparalleled change. This is most evident within
it's mutanting govermental system and tumultuous domenstic politics.

\subsection{expanding monarchary}
The position of \emph{Rei Dom}, the lord king, has grown increasing more powerful. 
The current ruler \emph{Jo√£o Braceo IV} and his precessors have taken steps to
centeralize the government and increase their own political power. More then ever, 
the monarch intevenes in local affairs, and has stunted the authority of the noblity.
The most drastic of these actions happen 18 years ago, when the former king \emph{Pedro Braceo II}
desolved the \emph{Cortes}.

This power shift has been aided by the establishment of the \emph{Inquistorius} and the 
backing of major Guilds. This rise of power has severally split the country. Many praise the 
strenghting of Rosinya due to the Kings divine guidance, while others have thrown 
accusations of tyranny.
