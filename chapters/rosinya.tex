\section{Geography} 
Sitting right on the center of vilterra's east coast. Rosinya enjoys a warm meditarean climate
with a rich land and coastal ecosystem. The country spreads across a diverse geographic
region which includes grasslands, temperate forests, low mountains, and ria coastlines.

\subsection{Weather} 
It is mostly sunny thoughout the years, exceptable for rain in the winter. 
This hosiptal environment is oft attributed to the grace of the revered 
storm god, \emph{Palid}. Although their might be an underlying current of his wrath,
as southern Rosinya has some of the roughest coastlines on the continent.
This tough enviroment has bred a powerful Naval culture which contributes 
to Rosinya's ability to project power overseas.

some searching from victims to drag prematurely into the afterlife, others more 
innocenly, observe the joys of mortal life their now lack.
