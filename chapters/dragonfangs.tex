\DndDropCapLine{T}{he home of the dwarven kings,} the haven of the drow,
the lair of dragons\ldots The mighty mountain range standing steadfast in the far,
far north of Vilterra is known by many, many things. To
most of the known world, it is known as the land of the
dragons --- \emph{Dragonfangs}

\section{Top of the World}
This Northern mountain range is well-known for its snow-capped, jagged peaks ---
the origin of two of its names: Dragonfangs and the Crown of the World.
While the title of the greatest mountain range is disputed (notably by the
sister range of the Spine of the World), the size of these behemoths of
dirt and stones are nothing to be scoffed at.

As one climbs up the Fangs, the biome varies drastically, leading to an interesting
vertical economy not seen in any other parts of Vilterra
(See~\ref{sec:grainsandgold}).
